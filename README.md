This is a work in progress, placed on github for backup purpose only.

### notes about the bib format

* There's always author, year and title
* @inproceedings usually have a "crossref" field

### TODO

Flag documents marked as "read later" : css class and a special button "OK, red it"

PDF uploading :

* when no PDF attached, show a icon suggesting you should drop a file there
* otherwise, show a link to the PDF, that may also handle an update upload

find by author, by year

"Generate bibtex" button, per document
and "Generate bibtex" button for all listed documents

doc details display... and doc edition with a fancy contenteditable
KISS: save doc as soon as an entry loses focus

### useful references

note: kanso's db module doesn't like vhosts (nor URL rewriting)
