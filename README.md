### TODO

Understanding bibs:

* There's always author, year and title
* @inproceedings usually have a "crossref" field

a better doc listing

"Generate bibtex" button, per document
and "Generate bibtex" button for all listed documents

doc details display... and doc edition with a fancy contenteditable
KISS: save doc as soon as an entry loses focus

then, PDF uploading on edition (easier to debug)

* when no PDF attached, show a icon suggesting you should drop a file there
* otherwise, show a link to the PDF, that may also handle an update upload

find by author, by year
