### notes about the bib format

* There's always author, year and title
* @inproceedings usually have a "crossref" field

### TODO

find a jQuery tag-editing plug-in, for both tags and authors

doc details display... and doc edition with a fancy contenteditable
KISS: save doc as soon as an entry loses focus

"Generate bibtex" button, per document
and "Generate bibtex" button for all listed documents


a validation doc that auto-updates "modified_at"

### useful references

note: kanso's db module doesn't like vhosts (nor URL rewriting)
