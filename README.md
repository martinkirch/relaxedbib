### TODO

Understanding bibs:
 - There's always author, year and title
 - @inproceedings usually have a "crossref" field

bibtex parser : all fields may go to a filter like someText.replace(/(\r\n|\n|\r|\s)+/gm," ");

doc edition
then, PDF uploading on edition (easier to debug)
attachment on new doc : only allow when there's only one entry !

### useful references

note: kanso's db module doesn't like vhosts (nor URL rewriting)
